# RustPlayground

Welcome to my Rust Playground! This repository is all about exploring the Rust programming language, from its foundational concepts to its advanced features. As I journey through learning Rust, I'll be adding various experiments, projects, and notes here. The goal is to understand Rust's unique approach to system programming, memory safety, and concurrency.

## What's Rust?

Rust is a multi-paradigm, systems programming language focused on safety, especially safe concurrency. Rust is syntactically similar to C++, but its designers intend it to provide better memory safety while maintaining high performance.

## Why Rust?

- **Memory Safety:** Rust's ownership model guarantees memory safety and encourages you to write efficient code without the overhead of a garbage collector.
- **Concurrency:** Rust makes concurrent programming more accessible by ensuring thread safety at compile time.
- **Performance:** With zero-cost abstractions, Rust allows you to write low-level code that runs as efficiently as possible, making it ideal for performance-critical applications.
- **Tooling:** Rust's package manager and build system, Cargo, makes it easy to manage dependencies, build packages, and share your code.

## Projects and Experiments

This section will evolve over time as I add more projects and experiments. Here's what you can expect to find:

- **Basics:** Explorations into Rust's syntax, data types, and control flows.
- **Ownership and Borrowing:** Deep dives into Rust's unique ownership system, including lifetimes and borrowing rules.
- **Concurrency:** Examples of how to write safe and efficient concurrent code in Rust.
- **WebAssembly:** Experiments with compiling Rust to WebAssembly for high-performance web applications.
- **CLI Tools:** Small command-line utilities written in Rust to solve various tasks.
- **Web Development:** Exploring web development with frameworks like Actix and Rocket.

## Learning Resources

As I learn Rust, I'll also share some of the resources that I find invaluable:

- [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) (The Rust Book)
- [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/)
- [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) - Small exercises to get you used to reading and writing Rust code!
